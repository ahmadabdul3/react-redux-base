- This entire project was built and designed (visually and architecturally) by me

## Running it

1. Clone the repo
2. Run sudo npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Navigate to localhost:3000
5. Browse :)

## Some notes

- The project is still in development so some things may not be fully functional
- There is currently a very minimal back-end that runs on express, but no database/data yet
- ~~Redux will be added once the back-end work begins~~ redux is here!
- Back-end will probably be rails + postgres

## The stack

- Node/Express back-end
- SASS 
- ReactJS
- ES6 - Stage 2
- React Router
- Webpack
- Gulp
- Redux ~~(coming soon)~~is here!
